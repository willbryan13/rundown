# Rundown

## Current State
*Front-end can be mounted in a chrome browser @ chrome://extensions/ by selecting "Load Unpacked" and loading the extension directory from the rundown repository.
*Back-end is currently in fragments as different hosting options are evaluated. The current idea is to use a deploy script to push the processing script and dependencies to AWS Lambda.
*Both REST API requests to Chat-GPT and the NLTK python package are being experimented with.
